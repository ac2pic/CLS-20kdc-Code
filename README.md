# CC Modding Proposals Staging Area

This is a staging area for the code involved in my CrossCode modding proposals.

As per the usual legal boilerplate requirements (I'm not a lawyer, so do alert me if I'm doing this wrong):

I'm not associated with Radical Fish Games, the code here may rely on but should not contain code from CrossCode, please don't sue me.
